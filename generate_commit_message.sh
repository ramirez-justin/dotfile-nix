I'll provide you with the diff of my changes, and you should:

1. Analyze the changes to understand what was modified.
2. Generate a commit message with:
   - A short, clear title (max 50 chars) that summarizes the change
   - A bulleted list description of what was changed and why (if possible)

Format your response as:
TITLE: [your generated title]
DESCRIPTION:
- [first point]
- [second point]
