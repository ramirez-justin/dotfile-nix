# darwin/homebrew.nix
#
# Homebrew package management for macOS
#
# Purpose:
# - Manages packages that are better installed via Homebrew
# - Handles GUI applications (casks) that aren't available via Nix
# - Maintains consistent font installation across systems
#
# Package Categories:
# 1. CLI Tools:
#    - Core System Utilities:
#      - File and disk management
#      - Directory navigation
#      - Mac App Store integration
#      - System monitoring
#    - Development Tools:
#      - Version control systems
#      - Build tools and compilers
#      - Development utilities
#    - Text Processing:
#      - Modern CLI alternatives
#      - Search and filtering
#      - Data format processors
#    - Terminal Utilities:
#      - System monitoring
#      - Shell enhancements
#      - Documentation tools
#    - Cloud Tools:
#      - Cloud provider CLIs
#      - Infrastructure management
#      - Version managers
#
# 2. GUI Applications (Casks):
#    - Development:
#      - Code editors and IDEs
#      - API testing tools
#      - Containerization
#    - Terminal:
#      - GPU-accelerated emulators
#    - System Tools:
#      - Keyboard customization
#      - Window management
#      - File utilities
#    - Browsers & Communication:
#      - Web browsers
#      - Messaging platforms
#      - Cloud storage clients
#    - Cloud Tools:
#      - Cloud platform SDKs
#
# 3. Fonts:
#    - Programming fonts with ligatures
#    - Terminal-optimized fonts
#    - Nerd Font variants for icons
#
# Configuration:
# - Auto-updates enabled
# - Brewfile generation
# - Mac App Store integration
#
# Note:
# - Some packages are installed via Homebrew instead of Nix because:
#   1. They require frequent updates (e.g., browsers)
#   2. They integrate better with macOS when installed via Homebrew
#   3. The Homebrew version is more up-to-date
#   4. They need system-level integration
#   5. They handle auto-updates better
#
# Usage:
# - New packages can be added to appropriate sections (brews/casks)
# - Use cleanup = "zap" for aggressive cleanup of old versions
# - Brewfile is auto-generated for backup/replication
# - Packages are organized by category for better maintenance
# - Comments explain package purposes and dependencies
