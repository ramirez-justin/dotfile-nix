# Installation Guide

A step-by-step guide for setting up your Nix Darwin configuration. This guide will walk you through the complete installation process, from prerequisites to post-installation setup.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, ensure your system meets all requirements and has the necessary tools installed.

### System Requirements

Your Mac needs to meet these basic requirements:

- macOS (Apple Silicon - M*)
- Administrative access
- Internet connection
- 10GB+ free space

### Required Tools

You'll need to install some basic development tools before proceeding:

1. **Command Line Tools**

   Essential development tools from Apple:

   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

2. **Rosetta 2** (if needed)

   Required for running Intel-based applications:

   ```bash
   softwareupdate --install-rosetta
   ```

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps in order. Each step builds upon the previous one.

### 1. Clone Repository

First, we'll get the configuration files onto your system:

```bash
# Create dev directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/dev

# Clone the repository
cd ~/dev
git clone <your-repo-url> dotfile
cd dotfile
```

### 2. Configure User Settings

Personalize the configuration for your use:

1. **Create user configuration**

   Start by copying the template:

   ```bash
   cp user-config.template.nix user-config.nix
   ```

2. **Edit user settings**

   Customize the configuration with your information:

   ```nix
   {
     username = "your-macos-username";  # Must match your macOS login
     fullName = "Your Full Name";
     email = "your.email@example.com";
     githubUsername = "your-github-username";
     hostname = "your-hostname";        # Your Mac's hostname
   }
   ```

### 3. Run Installation

Now we'll run the installation script that sets up Nix and all required components:

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x pre-nix-installation.sh

# Run installation
./pre-nix-installation.sh
```

## Post-Installation

After installation completes, verify everything is working correctly:

### 1. Verify Installation

Check that all major components are installed and working:

```bash
# Check Nix
which nix
nix --version

# Check Home Manager
home-manager --version

# Check Homebrew
brew --version
```

### 2. Initial System Build

Build your system for the first time:

```bash
# Build the system
rebuild
```

### 3. Shell Setup

Ensure your shell is properly configured:

```bash
# Reload shell
exec zsh

# Verify shell configuration
echo $SHELL
```

## Next Steps

After successful installation, you can:

1. Review the [Configuration Guide](configuration.md)
2. Check [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) if needed
3. Explore available [Tools](../tools/git.md)

## Uninstallation

If you need to remove the configuration and start fresh:

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```
